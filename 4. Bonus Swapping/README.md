# 4. Bonus Swapping

## Step 1: Changing an existing bonus
1. In your decompiled files, go to the app folder.
2. Depending if your using a normal incredibox install with multiple packs, or a mod with just one (such as Travis), you will see multiple "asset" folders, named asset-v1, asset-v2, etc.
3. Open the asset folder you want to edit (usually asset-v1) and then open the video folder, this contains the video files for the bonuses.
4. The video dimensions are 1000 x 400. Replace the video with whatever video you wish, just conform to the dimensions.
5. Leave this folder, and go to the sound folder, then ogg. Down the bottom the bonus and aspire files will exist. `aspire` is the leadup to the bonus, `bonus` is the actual audio for the video.
6. After modifying the files you wish, its time to recompile.
