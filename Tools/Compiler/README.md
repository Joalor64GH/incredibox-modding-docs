# Compiler
Compiling with dodgey GUIs no more! Compile from APK, or source to a windows EXE or a website with iOS support!

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher (Make sure to select the `Add to PATH` option)

## How to use:
### Windows
1. Download this entire repository, more convinient downloads for individual tools will be provided in future.
2. Direct to this folder, go to `Tools`, then `Compiler`.
3. Start by opening the `#install.bat` file and installing all required packages.
4. Then open `#start-compiler.bat`, a folder called `input` should appear.
5. Put in the appropriate files for your format.
6. Re-run the renderer by opening `#start-compiler.bat`, type in the option you want, and it will run, outputting your files to the `output` folder.

- [This repo](https://github.com/BovineBeta/Incredibox-IOS)! Created a great lil repo for documenting why iOS doesn't work, so made this segment easier for webapps!
