# Animation Renderer
Instead of booting the game everytime to check an animation, use this!

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher

## How to use:
Inside the folder with the `renderer.py`, place the json to be used and rename it to `anime.json` and the sprite sheet to use named `anime.png`.
Install the packages required with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
In the terminal, execute `python renderer.py` to use it.

### Optional, MP4 with music
To use the music, place the audio tracks in the folder, if its a single track name it `anime_a.ogg` and if its two tracks use `anime_a.ogg` and `anime_b.ogg`.
