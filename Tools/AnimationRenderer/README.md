# Animation Renderer
Instead of booting the game everytime to check an animation, use this! It also checks for pixel misalignment on the first frame, or in the silouette. No need to boot the game when animating, just build your animation with this.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher

## How to use:
Inside the folder with the `renderer.py`, place the json to be used and rename it to `anime.json` and the sprite sheet to use named `anime.png`.

Install the packages required with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

In the terminal, execute `python renderer.py` to use it.

### Optional, MP4 with music
To use the music, place the audio tracks in the folder, if its a single track name it `anime_a.ogg` and if its two tracks use `anime_a.ogg` and `anime_b.ogg`.
