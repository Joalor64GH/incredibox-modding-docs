# 3. Music Swapping
## Step 1: Changing the music
1. In your decompiled files, go to the app folder.
2. Depending if your using a normal incredibox install with multiple packs, or a mod with just one (such as Travis), you will see multiple "asset" folders, named asset-v1, asset-v2, etc.
3. Open the asset folder you want to edit (usually asset-v1) and then open the sound folder, then the ogg folder, then each ogg file matches to each character.
4. There will be two for each 'character' `_a` and `_b` (generally), `_a` accords to the first bar, `_b` being the second bar. Keep an eye on the length, your going to want the music your replacing to be the same duration. Some characters may have only 1 track, `_a`.
6. Once you've changed your music, its time to recompile.
