# Incredibox Modding Documentation
After doing a look around Incredibox's modding community, I found a severe lack of documentation and information on mod creation.

This repo will attempt to explain aspects of Incredibox modding from decompilation to final product.

> **Note**
> This is not a finished product, and is very open to critique. If you think something is badly explained, incorrect, or should be reworked. Open a pull request to fix it yourself, or file an Issue to see if someone else can.
