# 1. Decompilation

## Step 1: The easy part

### Windows
Firstly, go to the location of your Incredibox install, this can be found by doing the following:
1. Open Steam
2. Find Incredibox in your library
3. Right click it and go to Manage > Browse Local Files
4. The folder will open

Inside the folder will be one exe file, duplicate it and rename the file extension from .exe to .zip, then extract the zip.

You should now have a bunch of files, these are the 'source' code.

## Step 2: The slightly harder part

### Windows
1. Download [this](https://github.com/aardio/WinAsar/raw/master/dist/WinAsar.7z) and extract the exe file. This will be marked as dangerous in some browsers, if your worried the VirusTotal scans of the zip and exe are linked at the end of this page.
2. Once opened, there is an 'extract' button on the left, click it.
3. Up the top press 'open', then direct to the 'app.asar' file and open it.
4. Press extract at the bottom.
5. A new folder called `app.asar.unpack` will appear. This will contain all the decompiled files needed! Congratulations.
